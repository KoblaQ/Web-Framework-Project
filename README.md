WEB FRAMEWORK PROJECT 

Group 4

Collaborators: Sara-Sofia Paananen, Edem Quashigah, Marika Duhhanina

In this project we're creating a web page for our Web Framework Project course. We've decided to make a website with authentication system for a hotel which has a booking system. With this sytem the user is able to enter their own information and it will save it. Through the admin page we're able to get all of the user information and be able to implement the CRUD (create, read, update & delete) functionality into the page.

To make the web page we're using Node.js, RESTul API, MongoDB and handlebars.

WEB FRAMEWORK PROJECT 

Group 4

Collaborators: Sara-Sofia Paananen, Edem Quashigah, Marika Duhhanina

In this project we're creating a web page for our Web Framework Project course. We've decided to make a website with authentication system for a hotel which has a reservation system. With the user information given to us we're able to see all of the check-in's and check-out's of each individual.

To make the web page we're using Node.js, RESTul API and handlebars.
